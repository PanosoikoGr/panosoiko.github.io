# About Me

Hello! I'm **Panosoiko** ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm new to the field of **cybersecurity** but have already fallen in love with **penetration testing**. Currently, I'm studying **Electrical and Mechanical Engineering** at university, where Iâ€™m building a strong foundation in both technical skills and analytical thinkingâ€”key elements that support my growing passion for cybersecurity.

In addition to my studies, I am actively working on developing my skills in cybersecurity by exploring various tools, techniques, and frameworks commonly used in pentesting. I am excited to learn, collaborate, and grow in this field, and I am constantly looking for new challenges and opportunities to apply my knowledge.
